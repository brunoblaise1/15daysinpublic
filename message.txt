Howdy 🤠! People call me Malted.
I research computer graphics, write systems software,
do funky 501(c)(3) stuff, and make computers crunch
numbers in just the right way.

Most days, I push to github.com/hackclub. Other days,
I force push to github.com/malted. This site is open
source; go and find it, and follow me while you're
at it.

It's my job to;
Design hypertext documents
Write hypertext documents
💸 Give internet money wiiings 💸

It's not my job to;
Write shaders, yet I do it anyway

You should read;
☞ Why the Future Doesn't Need Us - Bill Joy for WIRED
☞ The Year of Living Danishly - Helen Russell
☞ docs.vulkan.org - KHRONOS Group
☞ My Family and Other Animals - Gerald Durrell

A random, awesome website I think you should visit;
https://malted.dev/???

As of 32m 14s ago, I'm in Vienna, Austria, which is
11045km away from Westerville, Ohio. That's like, a
whole world away. Why are you so far away? Why am I
so far away?? Questions that could be rendered moot
with a flight :)


Message me @Malted on the Hack Club Slack, or email
me at this domain. If you're in a pinch, call me at
malted at malted dot dev. I've got plenty of battery
right now (75%), so I'll probably answer your call.
