ðŸš€# My life story (up to {date})

# The Beginning

I started out as a baby, as we all do; but soon I grew and became a teenager. This is my story.

My parents have always told me that I was a very curious child. I got a set of tools for my 7th birthday and I immediately setup a small workshop in the basement of our house. I aquired several lights and a proper size hammer and thought it was the best thing ever. I would spend hours in the basement, bashing various rocks and watching them spark and frustrating my parents to no end with the damage I was doing to the concrete floor. My favorite thing to do was to take our recycling bin and find containers that would hold water, I would then use straws to build elaborate water systems that would flow from one container to another. I always wanted it to be more complex and interesting than the last.

# The Middle

My mom homeschooled me and my siblings and taught us to be curious about how and why the world works the way it does. I was constantly encouraged to ask questions about whatever I didn't understand. My favorite experiments we did were with electricity. We would build snap circuits and try to make things light up or move. I was always so excited to see what would happen when we connected the wires. I remember the first time I saw a lightbulb light up, I was so amazed that I had made it happen. I was so proud of myself and I wanted to learn more about how it worked.

# The Other Middle

As I grew older (the ripe old age of 10) I started to get into computers. I got a book from the library about the raspberry pi (Raspberry Pi For Dummies 2nd edition circa 2014) and I was fascinated by the idea of a computer the size of a credit card that could control electronics and robots. I ended up getting a BBC micro:bit and half a year later I got a rpi 3 B+ for christmas. I started coding using the blockly editor and then moved on to PHP of all things as my first language. My best memories of this time were sitting on the otoman in the living room with the cables stretching the to the TV and the keyboard in my lap, figuring out how to install wordpress and get MariaDB to work. I was so proud of myself when I finaly got wordpress working that I ran to my grandmother and told her to open the website on her phone. I was so excited to see it work and when it just displayed the html without any css I was so disappointed. I made that same mistake of setting localhost as the root domain at least 3 times in the next year of playing with wordpress.

# The Linux Years

After using the raspberry pi for a while my dad gave us kids an old dell laptop that he had used for work. It was running windows 7 (might have been 8 but i'm not sure) pro and was the coolest thing I had ever played with. We installed ubuntu on it and it took me 2 months to get sudo access after badgering my dad to enter his password every day for sudo apt-get install. My sisters would refuse to use that computer because I regulary tended to either break something or reinstall with some new experiment. I first started dual booting with windows when I turned 12 and discovered there was a 30G ssd in the laptop. I made my first desktop PC when I turned 13 and used the Linux as my main OS for its entire life. Picking out those parts on PCPartPicker was oh so exciting and discussing GPUs with my friend and reading Custom PC consumed me for over a year. Sadly I never did get a fancy GPU, I had to settle for a gt-1030 because of the great GPU shortage of 2020.

# The Homelab Years

I got my first server for a homelab the summer of 2022 when I was 14; technicaly I had been using my raspberry pi as a server for much longer than that though. It was a Lenovo ThinkStation P300 workstation with 32 GB of ram; I used it for proxmox and its been a solid machine for the last 2 years. I made a custom tool for my docker containers that would automatically pull the compose files from github and upgrade them if needed. I've ran several minecraft servers, many small selfhosted tools, a your spotify instance thats been running basicaly since I got the server, and a few other things including this website. I've learned so much about networking, linux, and docker from this server and I'm so glad I got it.

# The Present

Currently I'm working on a non-profit called Purple Bubble with some friends from Hack Club, building electronics projects, working on websites and other coding projects, and building a robot with my FRC team.

# The Future

I'm currently a sophmore in highschool and I'm currently planning in either dual majoring in english and computer science with a focus in cybersecurity or majoring in computer science with a focus in cybersecurity and a minor in english.

I hope to get an internship this summer at the Browser Company of New York (I meant to ask them last summer but was too busy moving with my family) and I'm excited to see where that takes me. I'm planning on continuing with robotics and taking some classes at a local college next year. If the BCNY intership doesn't pan out i'll probably get a job at my local community center and focus on trying to grow Purple Bubble this summer. I'm also planning on continuing to grow my Youtube channel "A Wanderer's Archives" and work on some projects i've been meaning to get to.
